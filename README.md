# Write multiple line of text contents into a text file
This Python script creates a file with multiple lines of text in it. As long as the user does not say there are any more lines, it asks them to enter text lines and writes them to the file. The code has error handling to deal with incorrect user input, making sure that the program keeps asking the user for input until a valid one is entered.
